								<hr>
								<p>
									His people can have two forms: human with snow leopard ears, tails and possible markings at some parts of their body, and their full snow leopard form. They are mostly agile, physical, and have a more hands-on way of doing things, but on rare occasions someone would be born with the magic of ice.
									<br><br>
									They are found in snowy mountain areas. They usually hunt and trade meat and fish for a living.

								<h4>Special physical traits:</h4>
								<hr>
								<p>
									Nyx's left eye is mostly white and is blind due to a birth defect. His turtleneck and his undershirt are both sleeveless. The black fingerless gloves he has stop just around in the middle of his forearms.

									Nyx may seem smart or skilled, but it's all the result of pure hard work and nothing else. He was considered weak when he was younger; he was slow when it came to learning, and he got sick and hurt easily. He got ridiculed because of it. When things started becoming a lot more difficult and complicated, he realized he needed to change. So he studied and trained until he caught up to everyone else. Now he was aiming to be better.
<br><br>
Due to his goals, he developed a strong work ethic that was almost unbelievable for a child his age, and on top of that, the fact that he could keep up such a routine meant his discipline is more than commendable too; you would rarely find him procrastinate homework, or study the day before an exam, or sacrifice his responsibilities just to have fun with his friends.  He thinks those are just like taking one step closer to failure, and if there's anything Nyx can't handle, it's failure. People expect a lot from him, and if he doesn't deliver, then he would be judged and ridiculed again. To prevent that, he becomes very critical of his actions. If he somehow manages to screw up, he just beats himself up for it before anyone else could do it, and it might take awhile before he could recover. He will recover though. He has to. 
<br><br>
If his motivation for wanting to study and train is somewhat questionable, consider his curiosity playing a big part in it. Nyx would love to learn something, anything, everything if he had the chance. No skill and knowledge is useless, he'd like to believe. So yes, people and himself has high expectation of him, he pressures himself too much, but all that aside, he can say he truly enjoys learning.
<br><br>
Nyx towards other people, if someone needs help with anything, he is easy to ask. He's approachable that way. His mother raised him to be civil, kind, chivalrous, and well-mannered, and he has been like that ever since. The only time you'll see him snap is probably when people go too far, when people steal his food, or when he sees other people causing trouble. Although just because he can be approached, doesn't immediately mean he'll say 'yes’ to whatever it is requested of him. He could help if he had the free time, or if they were working on the same thing -assuming said person won't distract him from it. But if it's really a 'no,’ he'll just offer an apologetic smile and say 'maybe next time.’ Because of this though, people often see him as someone cold, and quite of a snob. It made it quite difficult for Nyx to make and keep friends, and yes, often he felt lonely, but he thought true friends would understand and support him, and will be more than willing to spend time with him some other time. And when Nyx does get to spend time with his friends, he'd be sure to treasure it.

										<br>
										<div class='divider-draft center' ></div>
										<br>
										<p>
											<h5>Food</h5>
											<p>Nyx always loved the food his mother would bring him home whenever she comes back from doing trades. He just loves it so much, he could honestly be considered a glutton.</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Stuff Toys</h5>
											<p>Nyx's friends as a kid were his mother's trusted servants, so sometimes they were too busy to play with him. Stuff toys kept him company whenever he got lonely, and up until now, they help.</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Fireflies</h5>
											<p>Nyx is afraid of the dark, and honestly he's just thankful those little guys exist.</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Drawing and Writing Materials</h5>
											<p>Nyx practices art from time to time, and he really appreciates it when he gets new materials to work with.</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Small Trinkets</h5>
											<p>He associates them with his memories, emotions, the people he care for- honestly anything. He collects them and stashes them away in a small box.</p>

										<h4>Dislikes</h4>
										<br>
										<div class='divider-draft center' ></div>
										<br>
										<p>
											<h5>Darkness</h5>
											<p>Nyx was born with visual defects. Not only is his left eye blind, but the other eye also is not as good, making him unable to see in the dark, unlike the majority of his species can. In addition, he was locked in a dark room to train his senses, but instead it resulted to a phobia.</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Low Grades/Marks</h5>
											<p>It makes him feel disappointed in himself, much worse, it makes him feel like he disappointed his family. (Then again some may say his standard for 'low' is already high for others)</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Noise</h5>
											<p>One of the few things he really can’t take is too much noise, he finds it distracting and quite frankly irritating, specially when he’s studying.</p>
											<hr>
											<h5>Being Sick</h5>
											<p>Other than feeling icky and weak, the last thing he wants is to take time out of someone's day just to take care of him.</p>

									<h4>His Sect and His Family</h4>
									<span>Silvermyst Sect</span>
									<p>
										Nyx was born into a sect of snow leopards lead by his family, the Silvermyst. They resided in a heavily protected and secluded town on the mountains of Nortidano. They have the reputation of training the best hunters and warriors who either serve the clan in return or go out to the world to offer their services. They also accept trainees who aren't snow leopards and share their knowledge about smart and agile combat. All the trainees get the opportunity to learn under the wing of Nyx's family members, who are undoubtedly the most knowledgeable in the field.
<br><br>
His mother is Marxia Silvermyst, the current leader of the sect; a prodigy who started her training by the age of five, claimed her position as a leader at the age of eighteen, and lead the sect to flourish at the age of twenty one. She was quite honestly the perfect Silvermyst- until she had Nyx. He was conceived out of a drunken encounter with an unknown snow leopard during a trade at Skuu. Their people found this scandalous, but they thought at least they had an heir.
<br><br>
It didn't take long for them to realize that Nyx wasn't the heir they wanted either. They learned that Nyx was prematurely born, which eventually lead to his weakened immune system, as well as some visual defects, like his left eye being blind. He in no way fit the Silvermyst standards. It didn't help that the labor caused severe physical complications for Marxia as well, the damage making her unable to have another child.

									<h4>His Childhood</h4>
									<span>Innocence and the Truth</span>
									<p>
										Nyx was unaware of the issues his birth brought to his family or his sect. He just enjoyed his life as a kid. His mother loved him and raised him unconditionally despite her other responsibilities. She taught him everything he needed to know, like writing, reading, and counting, as well as other things like drawing and playing the piano. Whenever she had to leave for her job, Nyx was left with kind and caring servants of the house who he considered his friends, so he was never lonely. His mother was never gone too long anyway. He always looked forward to the stories she tells whenever she gets back, as well as the trinkets and food she brings for him. He always looked up to her mother, and he hoped to be like her one day. 
<br><br>
Marxia reassured him that he would. 
<br><br>
As he grew older though, Nyx started to be more aware of whispers and stares he and his mom would be receiving whenever they walked in the town, or played near the training areas. He slowly started to learn about how weak he actually is, and how he was expected to be like his mother, but at the same time no one believed he could. On top of that, people blamed Marxia for it, about how she spoiled Nyx too much, about how she wasn't thinking about the future of the sect by giving the majority of her time to a chuff that would never be worthy to be a leader.
<br><br>
Nyx didn't want that type of judgement to be directed towards them, especially not to his mother, so at the age of five, Nyx decided he wanted to be stronger. He decided he wanted to start training.
									</p>

								<h4>Training</h4>

									<h4>Arrangements</h4>
									<span>Improvement comes with a price</span>

									<p>He had told his mother and other family members of his goals, and everyone seemed delighted by it, except for Marxia, who had told him that he didn't have to start so early for his training. Nyx was determined though, so no matter how much Marxia tried to convince him, he was still going through with it. 
<br><br>
Marxia wanted to train him herself, but their other family members reminded her that she already had too many trainees under her care, not to mention upcoming trading deals that required her presence at the actual interaction. 
<br><br>
So instead Nyx was assigned to his grandmother's care, Azia Silvermyst, the same person who trained Marxia herself. Nyx's mother feared for her child's well being because she knew how strict and difficult her mother's training regimen is. Seeing as she couldn't talk Nyx out of it, she warned her mother instead. “Don't even think of harming my chuff. Do not make the mistake that I am above punishing my own mother.”
<br><br>
And that's how Nyx's training started. 
<br><br>
Despite Marxia's warning, Azia pushed Nyx to his limit. She didn't care whether his body was weaker than the others, her training regimen stayed the same. Nyx would always find himself over exhausted and/or injured by the end of the day, and he often considered giving up, but he would just remember that he wanted to make his sect, his family and his mother proud, and that would be enough to power through the hardships.
<br><br>
That arrangement lasted for three years. By eight, Nyx got a whole lot better admittedly, but he still wasn't up to par with the sect's standards, not to mention he often still got hurt from the training. He never told his mother about the injuries, because he feared that she would stop him when she finds out. He didn't want that, not when he felt he was making progress. Luckily, his injuries were easy to hide. Nothing really broke, just heavy bruises and deep cuts, nothing he can't hide using clothes and bandages. 
<br><br>
One thing his grandmother noticed particularly was that not only is his other eye blind, but the other also seemed to have bad eyesight. Nyx confirmed it, of course, and told them it wasn't something that could be changed so easily, but his family said that was simply unacceptable. So they thought it would be a good idea to try and enhance it by trapping him inside a dark room with multiple other trainees and try to fight them off. 
<br><br>
It didn't go as well as they thought at first.
<br><br>
Nyx was afraid of the dark already as a child, but it became worse after this whole ordeal. He could not see anything at all, and little did his family know that those trainees they trapped with him had some sort of jealousy and anger towards him, and they didn't hesitate to vent it out with a given opportunity. The only reason he was able to escape that room was because he felt a surge of power release from his body, and just like that the attacking stopped, replaced with sounds of struggling and growls.  
<br><br>
The other trainees found themselves frozen stuck on the floor.
<br><br>
That the moment it was revealed that Nyx had ice magic.
<br><br>
Although his family didn't expect him to win that way, they surely weren’t disappointed. It had been generations since someone in their sect could last use magic. That development changes everything.

									<h4>The Truth</h4>
									<span>Learn what to fight for</span>
									<p>Marxia found out about it too, because when she got home from a trading trip, Nyx was still very injured and quite obviously shaken up from the whole ordeal. Their arrangement was out of the bag and Marxia was enraged. She was close to exiling those family members and followers who had allowed it to happen if Nyx hadn't stopped her.
<br><br>
All things considered, they were still family. They had to stick together. And Nyx argued he had wanted to continue with the training despite the difficulties, just not the dark room again.
<br><br>
The only people who were exiled were those who had hurt Nyx. But the rest who were involved were given set of rules and punishments; they were to be doing house chores, increasing their training load, increasing their trading responsibilities, and raising their hunting quota, all of which lessens Marxia's workload, allowing her more time with her son because she will be training him from then on. The family members respected her wishes and did as they were told. 
<br><br>
As for Azia, due to her being retired, she was only given one rule: to stay away from Nyx. 
<br><br>
Nyx tried to convince his mother that she was being too harsh, that their family just wanted the best for their sect, that they were doing the right thing, even if it meant he was getting hurt. But Marxia held Nyx's shoulder firmly one night and looked him straight in the eye. 
<br><br>
“Do you think a sect that takes pride in the hardships of a child is something to be proud of? Is that the sect you really want to fight for?” 
<br><br>
Marxia's first lesson to him was that he shouldn't be the only one trying to make the sect better, but everyone else as well. 
<br><br>
Nyx at first didn't really know what to do with the information. He was confused and hurt, and quite honestly scared- because he wouldn’t know what he could do to correct that, when he believes he's one of the problems of its decline.
<br><br>
Marxia reassured him that the sect she will pass onto him will be the perfect sect. So all he had to worry about was doing his part.
<br><br>
Nyx can't help but think he needs to do something more.

									<h4>Outside the gates</h4>
									<span>It will only open for those who are worthy</span>
									<p>
										Nyx has been training under his mother for more or less two years now, as well as learning about his magic through scrolls and books. He was surely better than he was before, but he couldn’t help but feel he had hit quite a slump. He didn’t know whether he was learning enough, or fast enough, and he was growing frustrated with himself.
<br><br>
So when news about Vernantius opening had reached them, Nyx saw it as an opportunity. 
<br><br>
He had gathered his whole family -which hasn’t been together in a long time- to tell them about how he wanted to go study to Vernantius.
<br><br>
Initially, every single one of his family members were not up for it, especially with Vernantius’ history with humans, and some of their ancestors having fought in that war, and Marxia not really willing to send her chuff far away to study. But after Nyx argued that they can’t judge a species based on their past, and that Vernatius was known for producing the best graduates (so imagine that plus the training of Silvermysts), and not to mention that none of them were actually qualified to teach him about his magic, they conceded and allowed him a chance.
<br><br>
Most of them believed Nyx wouldn’t even get past the door anyway. Nyx almost agreed with them when he stood in front of the gates with his mother beside him for support. He watched students get rejected over and over again, and he saw how disappointed their parents looked when they couldn’t get in. He dreaded his mom looking at him like that.
<br><br>
But as it was his turn to try his luck, Marzia pulled him in the tightest hug and said, “You don’t have to do this, you know?”
<br><br>
Nyx was surprised, but he hugged back and nuzzled close. “I have to. I want to make you and the sect proud.”
<br><br>
Marxia gave him a sad smile. “My chuff, I will be proud, whether or not you get in.”
<br><br>
And Nyx almost hesitated because he didn’t want to leave his mother, but he knew what he wanted to do, so he gave his mother one last hug, a kiss on the cheek and a goodbye before he entered.
<br><br>
He won’t be seeing his mother for a while, because the doors opened for him. And as soon as he was welcomed by a small man, he knew he was starting a new path in his life.

									<span>... but it wasn't easy</span>
									<p>Nyx really didn’t know what to expect after he entered the gates, but he didn’t expect to see that many people, and they all looked different too. It wasn’t much of a foreign idea for him because his sect also accepted different kinds of creatures at their place. But what was different was that there were humans, and he was a bit hesitant about them due to the nature of their sect. But his mom had told him the proper etiquette at school, so he promised he would be civil. 
<br><br>
Someone had stepped on his tail though while he was walking around, and because he jumped from the pain, he had ended up hitting another person. That’s where he first met Jervis Lactarner and Sorata Evadane. A few apologies were exchanged in the form of candies, and then they had to get sorted into a house. 
<br><br>
It turned out that him and Sorata were in Yuiella, and so they were escorted to the same table where they were allowed to enjoy a banquet prepared specially for them. Nyx was looking to meeting more of his housemates - and he did because he did meet Alwyn Redmoore and Sol Solomon and the bug boy(but he hadn’t gotten his name at the time), but most importantly he was looking forward to food, eating them, but the food had other plans. From blood oranges to crying onions, the banquet table of Yuiella was pure chaos to the point that he even opted to using one of his spells (not that it helped much). Somehow that hashed itself out and everyone was just excited to go to their assigned dorm rooms.
<br><br>
The school had other plans apparently; they were thrown into a maze filled with traps and spiders, and they had to find their way to the Founders’ fountain, tell them a secret, then find their way back to the common halls. Nyx was honestly petrified. They were thrown into a dark maze in the night time! Luckily he had a glowing stone with him, and even better, he had managed to meet up with someone along the way, her name was Arystillus Speer, and together they went through the maze’s traps (which catapulted them at least five times into the air), and different kinds of spiders. 
<br><br>
At the fountain- he had to tell his founder, Julian, a secret he never wanted to say out loud. At first he had figured it was okay he was only a statue after all but when Julian had moved, and even wrote the secret down, he felt a certain dread that one day his secret may be found out. But before he could deal with that any further- him and Speer continued to the common hall.
<br><br>
He ended up being the first Yuiella kid to arrive and he was rewarded so (he wasn’t even aware it was a race). 
<br><br>
After a long day, they were allowed to retire to their dorms and he discovered that his roommate was none other than the boy he met earlier, Sorata. 
<br><br>
They decided to sleep and get enough rest for the start of their classes the next days.
